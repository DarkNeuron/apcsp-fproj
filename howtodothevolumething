basically take the areaofcircle2 and change it so that the first argument is a string that specifies the type of shape it should calculate the volume for, where it then
navigates to a function specifically for that shape and uses the parameters following the name of the shape in the command line to calculate the volume of the
shape. missing arguments are not a thing when using the command line for commands, so you dont need to implement a system to counteract missing arguments.
